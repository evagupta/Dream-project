TASK:

The task was assigned to design an application for the classroom project donation.

Approach Followed:
1.I have created a Splash which will take us to the MainActivity of the application.
2.Main Activity is having two components either List OF PROJECTS or the DONORS LIST.
3.In the List of Projects activity there is a list of all the projects with the key=DONORCHOOSE.
- If in this the param from server says it needs funding then the Donate button is visible and by clicking on that a person can
go to the donate activity and see the project name and the ID and can donate by adding the value into it.
- If a person only wants to view the data then they can go back to listAllProjects and then click on to the project title
and go to the project detail class.
4. Further by clicking on to the project URL a user can peep into the webview activity where a webview of the project will be open.
-There more details of the proposal will be given.
5.If a user returns to the Main Activity there a user will can go to Donor list there they can check the number of the donors
for each project.


DESIGNS: Resource files are properly managed,activities,listview,adapter and the webview used.



TEST CASES:
1.While clicking on the project title the correct project details should navigate.
2.While searching the list should search the correct results.
3.Validations should work properly i.e no search on empty field,no donation without empty fields.
4.Have verified the package name with the Junit.
5.Have verified the textvalue with the Espresso as espresso is the UI testing library.
